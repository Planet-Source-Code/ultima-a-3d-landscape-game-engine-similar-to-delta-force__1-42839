### Description

[UPDATED 15-4-2003] This is a Engine using DirectX 8, and it has an infinite Terrain (really!! :)), Perfect collision detection, Guns that "stick" to the Screen, Shadows, Water, Sound effects. It loads from a custom model file (actually a text file :)) and you can modify the "mission", just by using a notepad. !!!!!!!!WARNING!!!!!!!!!!!! IMPORTANT: DON'T enable shadows when you didn't do a full compile, it will take like forever to load. Even with a full compile, the program takes over 1 minute to load on my 1.7 GHz comp... Take caution ;). This program was designed for a Screen Resolution of 1600x1400, but it looks ok with a 1024x768 too, but you can't see the HUD. Lower Resolution don't show much of the program. If you weren't able to download it, go to my website: www.sturmnacht.de.vu The FIle is over 1 Meg.
